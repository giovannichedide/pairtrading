**Pair Trading Strategy: Vale and Gerdau**

In this repository, you will find a detailed explanation of a pair trading strategy developed to capitalize on market opportunities offered by Vale and Gerdau assets. This method is based on the analysis of the price ratio series, also known as "price ratio," between these two companies.

**What is Pair Trading?**

Pair trading is a strategy that involves combining two correlated assets. The idea behind this strategy is to identify when these assets deviate from their expected historical behavior and then open long and short positions. In this case, the assets in question are Vale and Gerdau, two companies in the mining and steel industry with a historically correlated price relationship.

**Analysis of the Price Ratio Series**

Analysis of the price ratio series is a crucial step for this strategy. The price ratio is a metric that represents the relationship between the prices of two assets. In our case, we are looking at the price of Vale divided by the price of Gerdau. The idea is to identify moments when the price ratio deviates from its historical average. This can indicate a trading opportunity, as, in theory, the price relationship should revert to its long-term average behavior.

**Executing the Strategy**
